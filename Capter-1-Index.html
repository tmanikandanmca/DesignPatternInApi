    <h1>What is decorator Pattern?</h1>
    <p>
        The Decorator Design Pattern in C# allows us to dynamically add new functionalities to
        an existing object without altering or modifying its structure, and this design pattern
        acts as a wrapper to the existing class. That means the Decorator Design Pattern
        dynamically changes the functionality of an object at runtime without impacting the
        existing functionality of the object.
